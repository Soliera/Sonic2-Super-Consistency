# Super Sonic Consistency Sprites
This mod is for the Decompilation of the 2013 mobile remaster of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This is still a very early WIP, but I aim to provide an equivalent to the consistency sprites in Sonic 3 Complete. At the moment there are only three basic alternative sprites, all for sonic looking up.

*Note that I am NOT that good with graphic design or pixel art*
## How To Install
